Project 3 readme

Python file p3.py is the only source code needed to run the project.  All experiments can be run via the function calls at the bottom of the file, where most lines are commented out.  Experiments can be run by uncommenting these lines.

run_random_games() is used to test the environment.  These agents take random actions.
run_friend_games() is used to run the Friend-Q experiment.
run_foe_games() is used to run the Foe-Q experiment.
run_q_learning_games() is used to run the Q-Learning experiment.
run_correlated_q_games() is used to run the CE-Q experiment.

In all cases, experiments are run and data is saved into a .csv file of the appropriate file name.  The data can then be plotted in any way you want.
