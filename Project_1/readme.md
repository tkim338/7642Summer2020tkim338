Project 1 readme

The project code can be run by simply running the python script "p1.py".  Necessary packages to run the code are matplotlib, numpy, and math.

A replica of Figure 3 should show up first and the program will wait until this window is closed before conducting the second experiment and plotting Figure 4.  The program will then wait again before starting Figure 5.

Individual figures can be generated by commenting out unwanted lines at the bottom of p1.py.  Function calls to generate the auxiliary figures in the report are also included at the bottom of p1.py and are initially commented out.  These can be uncommented to generate these auxiliary figures.
