issues:

fig 3
not presenting data repeatedly until convergence
not updating after full set instead of after each sequence

fig 4
using same update schema as fig 3
not setting initial values to 0.5 (using 0 instead, like fig 3)

overall
used first and last terminal states in error calculation, artificially decreasing it

Assumptions
Fig 3
	threshold = 0.0001
	alpha = 0.01
	initial weights = [0,0,0,...,0,1]
